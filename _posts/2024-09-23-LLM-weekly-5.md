**Updating**

Got some feedbacks from users and update two versions, 1.1 -> 1.2 -> 2.0, [details](Updating).

It real make me happy when I found someone is using and like my product (One detailed and patient issue and one five star chrome extension store).

The api break down for half hour when I deleted my previous payment profile in Google Pay because I need join a Youtube Premium family group. More attention is necessary when you do something that may influence your product.

### Exercise

Three times this week. There are too much sunshine after I get up on 8:00, it's not suitable to run. I should try to do it in the evening even it's hard to start.

### Thought

1) Useful product that can influence others really make me happy.

2) There is not further information about my study visa, I should start my plan B.

3) Uncertainty for future significantly influence the related plan, I should make enough good planB if uncertainty always exists.
