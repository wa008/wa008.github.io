I usualy read kindle on the bed before I fall asleep, I think the big advantage of reading kindle is that kindle leads less distractions. When I use computer and browser the website, it's so eary to do other think when a notification jump, like text messages app or gmail. In contrast, When I read on kindle, I only focus on kindle and nothing else. 

In the past, I just readed books on kindle. But recently, I found that I can send weekly The Economist edition to kindle to read news. But the weekly update cannot meet my requirement, because my wife spend much more time on preparetion on falling asleep. I realize that I can send more news into kindle to read. It's a much better choice than reading on the computer or Phone. 

The best choice is Hacker News, that is the most popular news source for tech. So, I build a project to send Hacker News contents to kindle. 

I think kindle or books is definitely a better choice to obtain information than computer or Phone, it can lead less distractions and improve the efficiency. The problems of books and kindle were slow update, but it can be solved by thiry-party service. We can solve this problem as long as we can fine high-quality data, even AI generated contents.
