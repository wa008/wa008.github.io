## Product

It's hard to get regular flow, business transformation is also hard than expectation to obtain.

Trust seems a big gap for normal user because my old account get some real transformations but new account cannot even it had more view and likes.

## Thought

### replace cost
replace cost is always high because I realize increased value can not meet the replaced cost for new product in most situations. NotebookLM is a typical sample, I thinks it's a geat product, but it definitely increased the cost.

replaced cost is always than expectation.

### Competitive programming
start to participant some contest in codeforces this week, making me enjoyable. Coding really make me happy, especially for this kind of contest. 

Instant feedback is the main reason, like [earthworm](https://github.com/cuixiaorui/earthworm), which is a instant-feeback english learning tool.

## Summary
