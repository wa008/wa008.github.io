## Product
### Triton
Try to debug the Liger-Kernel but found it works well except bfloat type.

Learning news about LLM translation and try to realise the whole one in this kind of project, like [cut cross entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09009)

### Glass
My glass broke on 1.9, I'm really blind when I lost my glass. This is first experience I broke my glass and realise that how the backup of glass is important. 

This is what I do next:

1) Buy the invisible glass, which is accessable immediately. I can use it untill I get a better option.

2) Buy one new in near store, the quality is maybe not well but practical. My degree of glass is really high, as a result, I can receive new glass after three days. 

3) Buy a good one. I found a great [blog](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=37194262&rand=472) about how to test degree of eyes and choose glass. So, I test eyes degree three times recently to get the accurate degree. I choose a brand of glass without fraud concerns and buy glass frame and lens online. 

### English
+ Podcast: practical, I need to keep the routine of listening everyday.
+ Read and comment: more patience is necessary
+ Books: I cannot read much. 

I will try more about podcast and books in the next week.

## Summary
It's essential to maintain a backup glass for high-degree person, even the invisible glass.
