This is the first week to work as a LLM inference engineer, the real work content is what I want in the past. 

I don't have much experience in this field, But it's still acceptable. 

To do what I like is nice, I can put all my energy into my work. I hope freshness is not the only reason and I can maintain this status for longer time.

Small company don't have mature manage system, there's also some advantage about this, for example, I don't need spend much or any time on formalistic work, which is also positive for my mood. 

What I'm doing is a new direction, there're much thing I should learn and there's less historical burden I shuold take, I like this status.
