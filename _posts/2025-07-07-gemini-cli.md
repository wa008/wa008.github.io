## Gemini-cli

Gemini-cli is command line tool supported by Gemini-2.5-pro model, it's a similar product with Claude-code by Anthropic but free, what's more, Google open source all code of Gemini-cli in github and receive 20k stars in only one day, 40k in three days, this's scene that never happened for a long time. 

I use Gemini-cli to generate a project which can transfer model from huggingface into modelscope, I need this feature for a long time. As a result, I complete this project in three hours, this make me suprise. Gemini-cli was good at search various api and to use them, which will consume much time for human. 

Gemini-cli is strong for me because 
1. Add/delete/modify file in command, which create more space for llm to use their ability. 
2. execute code and receive output after exectuing, iterate the code by executing on turn and another. 
3. When meet name alreadly be used, it will change a new name to test it, and recover the name before finis the code, small but interesting design. 

Gemini-cli really spent so much tokens, shows the determination of Google on AI. 

## hf-ms-transfer

I'm unwilling to start a new project or update a existing project naturally, it's hard to start, but, it's eary to continue after starting. In my opinion, this is the difference between nature and maturation. This also happens on hf-ms-transfer project, even it's not hard to finish. 

I think this is why many people always say that just do it rather than talk a lot, it's reasonable. it's everyone should overcome.
