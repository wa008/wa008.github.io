### Copilot-typed
GitHub Copilot, cursor, GPT-codex, winsurf, trae are representative products of Copilot-typed tools, their function is to help users complete code automatically when necessary. Of course, they provide interactive conversation for users with code as content, which is common feature. This is the direct usage intruction in coding field when LLM appears. 

### CLI-typed
Claude-code is the first CLI-typed coding assistant, after Gemini-CLI join the wars among CLI-typed coding assistants, cursor-CLI also was published on 8th August. CLI-typed tools are the representative products in vibe coding era, which means people can release themself from editors, What they only need to do is talking with LM and express their thoughts and opinions. 

I think the step from Copilot-typed to CLI-typed(vibe coding) is too big to be workable, LLM cannot transfer an idea or demand into product by himself. 

The main disadvantages of CLI-typed (vibe coding) is that LLM cannot solve complex projects because it's not good at designing the solution. but developers are good at that, especially for junior developers. It's not necessary to use LLM to solve all tasks. 

### Better tool
A better product should provide more space for junior developers to express their thought of design, and also provide more control space for users, some users really like the feeling of controlling and enjoy that, this also can help LLM program better code because the instrction is more clear. 

More specifically, I think develpers can design their project in any depth from generality to details by the new ideal tool, and LLM can program code based on the design from developers. 

In additon, there're more advantages in this way. 
1. Designing of developers could be seen as ideal documentation of project
2. It's easy to save the checkpoint of the project in the process of developing. 
3. Developers are not probably mad for multi-round conversations. 

Maybe this can be solved based on CLI-typed tools, but I'm not sure how to proceed in detail.
