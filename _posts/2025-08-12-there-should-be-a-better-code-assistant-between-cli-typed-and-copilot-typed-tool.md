### copilot-typed
github copilot, cursor, codex-GPT, winsurf, trae are representative products of copilot-typed tools, what they can do is to help users type more code automatically when necessary, or explain the code to users. It's the direct ustage in coding field when LLM appears. 

### cli-typed
After Gemini-cli join the wars of cli-typed with Claude-code, cursor-cli also was published on 8th August. cli-typed tools are the representative products in vibe coding era, which means people can release themself from editors, What they need to do is talking with LM and express their thoughts and opinions. 

I think the step from copilot-typed to cli-typed(vibe coding) is too big to be workable, or cli-typed can provide more control space for users, especially for junior developers.

### future of cli-typed tool
The root problem of vibe coding (cli-typed) is that LLM cannot solve the complex project because it's not good at design the system. but developers are good at that, especially for junior developers. It's not necessary to use LLM to solve all tasks, we know it's not an ideal solution. 

So, I think there will a better product which can provide more space for junior developers to express their thought of design, and also provide more control space for users, some users really like the feeling of controlling and enjoy that, this also can help LLM program better code because the instrction is more clear. 

More clear, I think develpers can design their project in any depth from generality to details in the new ideal tool, and LLM and program code based on the design from developers. 

In additon, there're more advantages in this way. 
1. Design of developers will be ideal documentation of project
2. It's easy to save the checkpoint of the project in the process of developing. 
3. Developers are not probably mad for LLM without multi-round conversations. 

Maybe this can be solved based on cli-typed tools, but I don't know how to do it right now, That's why I record my thought right now.
