# Life

I stay home for 14 days this time, it's long. 

I spent the first seven days with my families and last seven days with friends.

Everyone had different life, what are the same is that everyone have much pressure about life. 

Even though, there will be one or two friends who have much proactive atitude towards life, it's so nice to talk with them.

I want to be this kind of person.
