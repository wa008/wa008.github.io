## Product
### AutoBuilder
I want to build AutoBuilder which can build simple product totally by AI model, like static websites. Compared copilot or cursor, AutoBuilder and see the result base on the current code after we build and run them. 

As a result, AI image model can provide feedback for current code, which can help text model to be better.

First version is too ideal. After I show the static website, I must input sth and click one button to test the result of function, it's hard to implement this process automatically. So I change to another direction.

I think developer should involve more in the process of programming and building. Developer can be the role of evaluation, he can provide feedback for the result of websites. Meanwhile some of the reasons I do this are I realize the weaknesses of AI model, so, more work of developer are necessary to build a mature product. What's more, I can update the process if my though works, This is important lesson I learnt from this project.

Think about below points when you design the road of your new product.
1. Start project from point where ROI is highest, low cost and high benefit.
2. Make it iterable when there are more features.

### Triton
Find a great project for me to learn Triton, which is [Triton-Puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Triton-Puzzles)

## Thought
### Table tennis
I enjoy table tennis a lot this week, shows the importance of positive feedback. That's why I think money also can be important when working.

### Evaluation of AI
Evaluation seems became the most important thing in AI period.

Most people talked about the importance of prompt, but the sound is less and less with the development of AI. The existing of prompt engineer show the weaknesses of AI in the initial period of development, reinforcement learning from human feedback can totally solve this kind of problem, but this is relative expensive, Google queries are also great option to meet this kind of problem. When I use ChatGPT, I also realize this’s not big deal. As a result, How to Evaluate the validation of response of AI models becomes the only issue.

Evaluation is a high level task than generations, the straightforward method is the done by human. Many product are produced in this kind of form, like AI coding assistant. Actually, human evaluation and feedback can be the bridge between AI model and mature products. When AI models are not mature enough, human can provide feedback one time again and again, that’s why we called AI as an assistant. 

How to check how much worked can be replaced by AI models? Try to find an automatic method of evaluation, if there is, it can be replaced finally. This remind me the work as an engineer in anti-fraud field. The most difficult part of my work is to determine whether if one user or flow a fraud. This is hard to be decide by AI model. Consequently, we can implement AI models in fields where there is solid evaluation method on. Coding is definitely first field. 

Competitive programming is also filed where I want to build a AI tool. It’s easy to get a solid bad case when wrong answer is returned for submitted code. I will try it after AutoBuilder. 

### History news
How about to read news happened in the past, like one year ago or three years ago. Like HackerNews one years ago content. 

We can know whether the thing are important or not, we know more how to evaluate whether one thing it’s important or not.

What kinds of documents of news can be read
1. The economist
2. Hacker News
3. v2ex
4. News magazine 

Internet is a great tool to realize that.

### Keyboard for iPad
Today, I bought a new keyboard for my iPad, which is useful when I just brought a iPad outside. Actually, I don’t have a laptop since I was in the third years in my university. Laptop is always not a good choice whether in any environment, it more likely an intermediate product. When people work in a stable place, like working environment or personal house, he usually need a huge monitor and comfortable keyboard, the original screen and keyboard of laptop is unused. In contrast, laptop is a little heavy to carry outside.  For me, I don’t like carry such a huge thing outside. Of course, more important reason is that I don’t have a laptop right now and just have a iPad, which also can support my demand of outside temporarily.

I don’t know why I have more patience to write something when I write towards a small screen, it’s an interesting phenomenon. Maybe it’s easy to concentrate for me when towarding a relative small screen.

## Summary
Table tennis seems make my life better. Enjoy more.

Spent less time on Phone and short videos, which is a great trend.
