This is the second time period that I need to seek a job position in my life till now. I don't have much experience to take a interview in the past, I think I learn a lot this time. 

**First lesson I learn**

Preparation is necessary for me to seek a better job than that in the past, not only for the project experience or basic knowledge, but also the attitude and future plan. I need to prepare for some dedicated time even not enough before the interview. 

**Project experience**

Interview will let me know which project I have done is important and valuable, I should do that more in the future.

**Basic knowledge**

I will review all basic knowledge before interview, it's a opportunity to review all details or theoretical knowledge.

**Future plan**

Failed interview let me know what I should learn in the future, This is a good way to get the new direction.
