# 4.24

The topic today is about city, city is a common topic in ielts(International English Language Test System), for many other topic, it's still relvative to city.

First is about transportation system, transportation system is one of the most important part for a city, it decides how convient and fast people can move from one place to another place. For people who is employee in the company, the convenient transportation can make them having more chooses when they are seeking a job or considersing change a job. for beijng which is almost the most biggest city in china, people who living in bejing can work in any company as long as it's located in bejing, the apartment of one of my pre-colleague is away 33km from our company, it only take one and half hour on the road becuase beijing has the most convenient subway system in the world.

Second is price, In rencent years, it's getting increaseingly expensive to do or buy anything, include the necessity, people must pay more to buy something than in the past. so, people must earn more mongy to deal with the expenses. This situation is more serious in the big city relative to small city and town.

Third, it's about job oppotunity, there are more and better jobs in big city, that is why more people will leave their hometown and go to big city. The population in big city is going up in rencent yeats. It's not convenient to take care of their parents for the people who settle in another city rather than their hometown, especially when their parents becoming older. It's a serious problem that the government should pay attention to.
