The hourse I rent now will be out of date in june, I looked for the next apartment for my girlfriend and I, of course, my gf is the main memeber to stay in the new apartment. It is a complex process to pick a suitable apartment, we look six apartment but niether of that is suitable for us.

In the afternoon, The learning process is hard, I can't help to play my Phone when I am learning. Anyway, I still finish my reading task today, in the evening, I ride my electric bike to take my gf back home, the air temperature make the weather great, I am also full of satisfaction because of the finished task in the afternoon, That moment make the hard process in the afternoon worthwhile. It will be better tomorrow. Good night.
