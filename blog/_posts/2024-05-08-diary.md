The hourse I rent now will be out of date in june, I looked for the next apartment for my girlfriend and I, of course, my gf is the main memeber to stay in the new apartment. It is a complex process to pick a suitable apartment, we look six apartment but niether of that is suitable for us.

In the afternoon, The learning process is hard, I can't help to play my Phone when I am learning. Anyway, I still finish my reading task today, in the evening, I ride my electric bike to take my gf back home, the air temperature make the weather great, I am also full of satisfaction because of the finished task in the afternoon, That moment make the hard process in the afternoon worthwhile.

The day before yesterday, I finish a ielts reading task, thereafter, I read the translation carefully. The essay says a story about art, specificly, it talk about the painting. For most people, we always go to museum to enjoy the famouse painting when we want to see some. But for novel, we don't usually look the original handwriting version, instead of that, we will read the copy version of that. Nowdays, the copy technology is good enough to copy a painting with all characteristic. The essay express that the owner of original painting is one of the reason to encourge perple to enjon orginal painting instead of copy version, that can keep the value of original, not just owner of painting, the owner of museum, relative to original painting may all have this thought. 

I don't know if this message is true or not, what impress me deeply is that there are so much critical thought and essay when I read english essay. Critical thinking is helpful for seeking facts and essiential for the society.

Today, I already studyed with a cycle plan, subsequently, I reviewed what I learned in the last seven days, I find that I don't learn that well, I don't have enough patience when I did some task. This plan is not good enough, at least is not suitable for me.

Tomorrow, I will change my learning plan of preparing my IELTS test, hope next plan is better.
