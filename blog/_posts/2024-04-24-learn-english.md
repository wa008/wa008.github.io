# 4.24

The topic today is about city, city is a common topic in ielts(International English Language Test System), for many other topic, it's still relvative to city.

First is about transportation system, transportation system is one of the most important part for a city, it decides how convient and fast people can move from one place to another place. For people who is employee in the company, the convenient transportation can make them having more chooses when they are seeking a job or considersing change a job. for beijng which is almost the most biggest city in china, people who living in bejing can work in any company as long as it's located in bejing, the apartment of one of my pre-colleague is away 33km from our company, it only take one and half hour on the road becuase beijing has the most convenient subway system in the world.

Second is price, In rencent years, it's getting increaseingly expensive to do or buy anything, include the necessity, people must pay more to buy something than in the past. so, people must earn more mongy to deal with the expenses. This situation is more serious in the big city relative to small city and town.

Third, it's about job oppotunity, there are more and better jobs in big city, that is why more people will leave their hometown and go to big city. The population in big city is going up in rencent yeats. It's not convenient to take care of their parents for the people who settle in another city rather than their hometown, especially when their parents becoming older. It's a serious problem that the government should pay attention to.

Part is today's topic, park is a great place to walk and enjoy nature view for people lived in the city.

The summer park is the most famous park in beijing city in my heart. It's built about sixty years ago. in history, emperor usually spend summer season in summer park becuase summer park is a special palce which can provide cold environment in summer, That's why it is called summer park. There is a big lake called kunming lake in the center of park, which occupied senventy-five percentage of the whole erea of summer park, This is one of the main reason summper park is relatively cold in summer. There is a little mountain in the north of the park, many temples are built on the mountain, people visited summer park usually ask for good luck in these temples. summer park is also full with trees and grassland in the other place, that make the air cold in summer. There are lots of people visited summer park every day, in summer, they can enjoy the cool environment in park, in winter, they also can enjoy the beautiful lake view standing on the mountain. The great park not only attract local people to visit, but also foreigners, you can often see foreigner when you are walking in summer park.

Chaoyang park is the biggest park in the east of beijing, The day before yesterday, my colleagues ask me to go to the biggest book market in beijing which is hold in chaoyang park, it lasts for eleven days. There are lots of selling book stall, I never ever see so large palce which is just selling books. beijing book market also have very long history and the scala of beijing book market twenty years ago is ten tieme than it is right now according the information from one of my colleague who lived in beijing many many years. Information cocoon room is a popular word rencent years, it mean people always stay in a small and stable information, they can't touch other information. Book market is a great place to break the information cocoon, There are all kind of different books in book market, There is a possibility for everyone to touch the book which is inaccessible in their daily life. But with the development of computer, like personal computer and smartphone, people are spending more and more attention on social media like tiktok, They don't have much time to hang out on book market and read books. 

In my previous thought, I should wirte nature view about the park topic. But I write many my thought about the society and life, writing is so great way to help people to deeply think, and it's not hard to do that. I should insist on that. I can talk more nature view next time. 

Now is half past ten, it's time to make lunch.
