# 3.26 Ride a bike
I like ride bike, I ride bike twice in this weekeed for about senventy kilometers, there are many reason that i like it, I enjoy the feeling of freedom when I’m ride, It’s like I can go to anywhere if I want, I like the wind, the smell of air outdoor.

yestarday, I find the other thing that I can get from riding a bike, that is the scene of river, I like river of sea very much, they are boundless, the water is transparent and clean, that will make me peaceful, I enjoy that feeling well.
