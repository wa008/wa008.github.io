  "text" : "Hi HN! I’m proud to share that we have built a real 3rd party iMessage client for Android. We did it by reverse engineering the iMessage protocol and encryption system. It&#x27;s available to download today (no waitlist): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.beeper.ima\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.beeper.ima</a> and there&#x27;s a technical writeup here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.beeper.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-beeper-mini-works\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.beeper.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-beeper-mini-works</a>.<p>Unlike every other attempt to build an iMessage app for Android (including our first gen app), Beeper Mini does not use a Mac server relay in the cloud. The app connects directly to Apple servers to send and receive end-to-end encrypted messages. Encryption keys never leave your device. No Apple ID is required. Beeper does not have access to your Apple account.<p>With Beeper Mini, your Android phone number is registered on iMessage. You show up as a ‘blue bubble’ when iPhone friends text you, and can join real iMessage group chats. All chat features like typing status, read receipts, full resolution images&#x2F;video, emoji reactions, voice notes, editing&#x2F;unsending, stickers etc are supported.<p>This is all unprecedented, so I imagine you may have a lot of questions. We’ve written a detailed technical blog post about how Beeper Mini works: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.beeper.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-beeper-mini-works\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.beeper.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;how-beeper-mini-works</a>. A team member has published an open source Python iMessage protocol PoC on Github: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JJTech0130&#x2F;pypush\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;JJTech0130&#x2F;pypush</a>. You can try it yourself on any Mac&#x2F;Windows&#x2F;Linux computer and see how iMessage works. My cofounder and I are also here to answer questions in the comments.<p>Our long term vision is to build a universal chat app (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.beeper.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;were-building-the-best-chat-app-on\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.beeper.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;were-building-the-best-chat-app-on</a>). Over the next few months, we will be adding support for SMS&#x2F;RCS, WhatsApp, Signal and 12 other chat networks into Beeper Mini. At that point, we’ll drop the `Mini` postfix. We’re also rebuilding our Beeper Desktop and iOS apps to support our new ‘client-side bridge’ architecture that preserves full end-to-end encryption. We’re also renaming our first gen apps to ‘Beeper Cloud’ to more clearly differentiate them from Beeper Mini.<p>Side note: many people always ask ‘what do you think Apple is going to do about this?’ To be honest, I am shocked that everyone is so shocked by the sheer existence of a 3rd party iMessage client. The internet has always had 3rd party clients! It’s almost like people have forgotten that iChat (the app that iMessage grew out of) was itself a multi-protocol chat app! It supported AIM, Jabber and Google talk. Here’s a blast from the past: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;k6rmOgq.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;k6rmOgq.png</a>.",
