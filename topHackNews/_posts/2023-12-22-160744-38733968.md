  "text" : "Hey!<p>I made Heynote entirely for my own use case. For many years, I always had an Emacs instance running with the scratch buffer open, even long after I had abandoned Emacs as my programming editor in favor of more recent IDE:s.<p>The simplicity of having just one big scratch buffer appeals to me, but I still want to separate the different things I jot down somehow (without using tabs or similar). Previously, my solution was to insert a bunch of blank lines between the notes, but hitting C-A would still select the entire buffer. That&#x27;s why I came up with the concept of &quot;blocks&quot;, which turned out really well for my use cases.<p>I decided to release Heynote, thinking it might be useful to others.",
