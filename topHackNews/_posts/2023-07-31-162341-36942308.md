  "text" : "Hey there HN!\nMeet Linkwarden, a fully self-hostable, open-source collaborative bookmark manager to collect, organize and archive webpages.<p>Please also visit&#x2F;star our GitHub repo [1].<p>Linkwarden was built using TypeScript and NextJS, backed by a PostgreSQL database for the lighter-weight data. The rest of the data can be chosen either to be stored on the filesystem, or stored on the cloud on Digital Ocean Space&#x2F;AWS S3, the reason for the cloud storage solution was for the Cloud offering [2], we realized that the preserved webpages (archives) take up space pretty quickly and S3 was much more efficient for this task. On the front-end we used TailwindCSS for styling and Zustand for state management.<p>You could either use our Cloud offering (with 14-day free trial) to directly support this project and experience Linkwarden, or you could self-host it on your own machine and have maximum flexibility.<p>Feel free if you had any questions, we&#x27;ll do our best to answer it.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linkwarden&#x2F;linkwarden\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linkwarden&#x2F;linkwarden</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.linkwarden.app&#x2F;register\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.linkwarden.app&#x2F;register</a> - Hosted in Digital Ocean&#x27;s datacenter located here in Toronto, ON.",
