I&#x27;m Jarek, and I&#x27;ve built this tool that allows publishing .local domains on the local network using mDNS.<p>It also has a reverse proxy that handles HTTPS termination and port forwarding.<p>I&#x27;m working on adding more features, like an index page with all available domains or allowing proxy redirects, so you could redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.<p>Let me know if you have any questions or feedback!",
