  "text" : "Hello HN, Talk2Arxiv is a small open-source RAG application I&#x27;ve been building for a few weeks. To use it just prepend any arxiv.org link with &#x27;talk2&#x27; to load the paper into a responsive RAG chat application (e.g. www.arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1706.03762 -&gt; www.talk2arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1706.03762).<p>All implementation details are in the GitHub. Currently, because I&#x27;ve opted to extract text from the PDF of the paper rather than reading the LaTeX source code (since I wanted to build a more generic PDF RAG in the process), it struggles with symbolic text &#x2F; mathematics, and sometimes fails to retrieve the correct context. I appreciate any feedback, and hope people find it useful!<p>Currently, the backend PDF processing server is only single-threaded so if embedding takes a while please be patient!",
