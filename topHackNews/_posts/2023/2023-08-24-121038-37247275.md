It offers some powerful features like &quot;get me all the CREATE queries that ran in the past hour&quot;. These are generated by AWS RDS Instance running on my Rocketgraph account. Then they are forwarded to Cloudwatch for complex querying. In the future we can connect these logs to slack so you can get slack alerts when a developer accidentally DROPs a table.<p>If you like my work, please check it out here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RocketsGraphQL&#x2F;rgraph\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RocketsGraphQL&#x2F;rgraph</a><p>And if you want this logging on your own Postgres instance. Use <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rocketgraph.io&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rocketgraph.io&#x2F;</a>\nAnd setup a project. pgAudit is automatically installed.",
