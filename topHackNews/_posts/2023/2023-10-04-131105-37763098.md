Wrote this game over a few days and was productive in Godot basically instantly. I couldn&#x27;t get up and running in Unreal despite trying a few times.<p>It&#x27;s my ambition to start a niche agency developing 80&#x27;s style games of skill and chance for the corporate world.<p>So... If anyone has any leads for making Space Invaders for Nike - please help! Happy to pay 5% on whatever work I get.",
