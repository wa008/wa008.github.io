  "text" : "Hi all, excited to share our latest work, OK-Robot, which is an open and modular framework to perform navigation and manipulation with a robot assistant in practically any homes without having to teach the robot anything new! You can simply unbox the target robot, install OK-Robot, give it a &quot;scan&quot; (think a 60 second iPhone video), and start asking the robot to move arbitrary things from A to B. We already tested it out in 10 home environments in New York city, and one environment each in Pittsburgh and Fremont.<p>We based everything off of the current best machine learning models, and so things don&#x27;t quite work perfectly all the time, so we are hoping to build it together with the community! Our code is open: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ok-robot&#x2F;ok-robot\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ok-robot&#x2F;ok-robot</a> and we have a Discord server for discussion and support: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;wzzZJxqKYC\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;wzzZJxqKYC</a> If you are curious what works and what doesn&#x27;t work, take a quick look at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ok-robot.github.io&#x2F;#analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ok-robot.github.io&#x2F;#analysis</a> or read our paper for a detailed analysis: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2401.12202\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2401.12202</a><p>P.S.: while the code is open the project unfortunately isn&#x27;t fully open source since one of our dependencies, AnyGrasp, has a closed-source, educational license. Apologize in advance, but we used it since that was the best grasping model we could have access to!<p>Would love to hear more thoughts and feedback on this project!",
