  "text" : "Hi HN,<p>YC w24 company here. We just pivoted from drone delivery to build gpudeploy.com, a website that routes on-demand traffic for GPU instances to idle compute resources.<p>The experience is similar to lambda labs, which we’ve really enjoyed for training our robotics models, but their GPUs are never available for on-demand. We are also trying to make it more no-nonsense (no hidden fees, no H100 behind “contact sales”, etc.).<p>The tech to make this work is actually kind of nifty, we may do an in-depth HN post on that soon.<p>Right now, we have H100s, a few RTX 4090s and a GTX 1080 Ti online. Feel free to try it out!<p>Also, if you’ve got compute sitting around (a GPU cluster, a crypto mining operation or just a GPU) or if you’re an AI company with idle compute (hopefully not in a Stability AI way) and want to see some ROI, it’s very simple and flexible to hook it up to our site and you’ll maybe get a few researchers using your compute.<p>Nice rest of the week!",
